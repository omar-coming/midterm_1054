            Cats are about as annoying as an animal can get, they have sharp claws, sadnpaper tongues
            and they shit in your house on a good day. 
            
            Not to mention the hairballs, ruined furniture, scratches on your arms
            and sleepless nights that are sure to enthrall you with joyous emotions.

        We put up with them because:
        Below the entitlement, maliciousness, and monotony of their behavior; There is a friend
        that no human could ever hope to match. A buddy to conquer the world with. 
        Also, nothing says adorable like cats. Their baggy jumpsuit-esque skin that's floppily overlaid on their
        fragile yet fierce skeletal structure.
    
        They're pretty much overgrown squirrels.
